  <p class="text-base w-full max-w-4xl col-span-2 text-gray-900 mb-8">
    Priority Review Vouchers (PRVs) accelerate FDA review by 4 months, reducing the timeline from 10 months to 6. These transferable vouchers incentivize rare disease research - smaller companies can sell them to fund continued research, while larger companies use them to expedite their own programs.
