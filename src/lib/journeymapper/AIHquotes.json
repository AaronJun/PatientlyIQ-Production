I have a small child so I do catch things from them very easily, though. I wash my hands a lot to try to keep down those chances, and it works. I have only caught things when she sneezed/coughed right in my face.\n\nYou can get any vaccine that isn't live. For example, if someone asks about getting an MMR, you can't because it's live.\n\nI'm not sure about the lifestyle question. I do suffer from pretty terrible fatigue and that could be the AIH, the med, or another condition that I have. There are also certain foods I was told to avoid: sushi, oysters, deli meat, and only eat well done steaks.
