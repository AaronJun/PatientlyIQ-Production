# FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program

## Program Overview

The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) Program was established in 2012 as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. This program aims to encourage the development of new drugs and biological products for the prevention and treatment of rare pediatric diseases.

## Program Impact

Since its inception in 2012, the program has successfully incentivized the development of numerous treatments for rare pediatric diseases. Priority Review Vouchers have become valuable assets in the pharmaceutical industry, often selling for substantial amounts and creating a secondary market that further drives investment in rare disease research.

## How Vouchers Work

When a sponsor company receives approval for a drug designated for a rare pediatric disease, they may receive a Priority Review Voucher. This voucher can be used to expedite FDA review of a future drug application or sold to another company.

Priority review reduces the FDA's target review time from 10 months to 6 months, potentially allowing faster market access for important new medicines.

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for a voucher, a drug must:

- Treat a rare pediatric disease
- Receive rare pediatric disease designation
- Be eligible for priority review
- Meet certain qualifying criteria upon FDA approval
- Be deemed eligible for priority review voucher at time of approval

## Market Dynamics

The PRV program has created a unique marketplace where vouchers can be bought and sold. Prices have ranged from approximately $67 million to $350 million, with a median price around $110 million. This market allows smaller companies to monetize their vouchers to fund further research, while larger companies can purchase vouchers to accelerate their development programs.
