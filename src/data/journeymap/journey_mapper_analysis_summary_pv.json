      "summary_text": "Patients with PV often struggle with fatigue, travel logistics, and anxiety around blood draws, especially given the phlebotomy-dependent criteria and regular hematocrit monitoring. Study design shows friction hotspots at transitions between double-blind and open-label phases. Sentiment terms such as 'exhausting', 'repetitive', and 'hopeful' appear frequently. Protocol burden is highest during the first 32 weeks, with fewer mitigations in place for participants during the long-term extension period. Participant burden reduction efforts must focus on improving PRO collection UX, minimizing redundant labs, and supporting self-administration in Part 2.",
