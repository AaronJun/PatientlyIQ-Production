            If one word can be used to describe this community, "active" would be a suitable candidate. <br><br> 
            The APOE4 community is active in their search for options. They are active within online and offline communities. They are active in learning more.<br><br> 
            They actively worry. And they actively hope for something new and breakthrough.<br><br>
            This provides ample opportunity for industry to engage with the community at key moments of their journey. Active outreach via educational materials about the benefits of genetic counseling, research findings written in plain language and broadcast through multiple channels, and active partnerships with patient advocacy groups could help build trust and understanding.
