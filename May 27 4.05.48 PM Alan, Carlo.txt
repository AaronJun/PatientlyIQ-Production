    "text" : "Welcome to Kaibora Healthcare Insight and today I have the privilege to have my friend Carlo Denatore Stefani joining us and we have a very interesting conversation about the state of manufacturing in the biopharma industry today as well as what we perceive to be potential challenges coming our way. Carlo, it's a pleasure having you join the podcast. So you and I just saw the background on how we got to know each other. I think you were at Bristlemeyer Squibb at the time working on a transformation of a region, Project Arrow in Latin America and you were leading the tech ops operation at Bristlemeyer Squibb and so we got to interact. Take me through your background and where you come from and where you studied and what your career in the biopharma industry has been. We share some common experience at Bristlemeyer Squibb. Those were interesting times, right? But times have always been interesting in our industry for many, many years. A little bit of background about me. I'm originally from Italy. I was born and raised in Italy. I'm a chemical engineer by training. I went to school in southern Italy, Naples as a matter of fact, where I was born and I grew up. And I come from a very unusual family in a sense, which I realized only later growing up because my father was a chemical engineer like me and they run a business, a manufacturing business. My mother, she was a professor of British, English and French literature and language. And so I grew up in Naples, which is a pretty nice place.",

But then growing up, I started to work on my father business, which was a manufacturing business. And so I found that attractive too. And so I kind of flipped the coin when the time came to go to college. And the result was I went to engineering school. I learned chemical engineering. In the meantime, my father's business had folded following the oil embargo. It was a manufacturing business on plastics for the construction industry. And Italy went through a significant crisis like many countries at that point in time. I went to school. I liked it very much."

About 5000 people died in Southern Italy. And so being an engineer, being in the army and having been an earthquake, I was shipped to the area where the earthquake had struck. And so I had this first experience in dealing with the with a relatively large organization and having to manage operations. Our job was to demolish demolition. Our job was to demolition. Our job was to demolition buildings which had been damaged by the earthquake and build prefabs, rebuild bridges, roads, and so help the towns which had been basically destroyed rebuild the normal life. I did that for a year and a half as an officer. And then I started my first job in the engineering."
