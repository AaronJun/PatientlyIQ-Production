# Form Catalyst to Enduring Impact: Sarepta Case Study

# Abstract
This paper examines the impact of the FDA's Priority Review Voucher (PRV) program on drug development for rare pediatric diseases, focusing on Sarepta Therapeutics as a key case study. Through analysis of regulatory outcomes, economic trends, and company strategies, we evaluate the program's effectiveness in stimulating innovation, its effects on drug pricing and patient access, and its relationship to other pharmaceutical incentives.

# 1. Introduction: PRV Program Background
The central rationale of Priority Review Vouchers (PRVs) is to motivate drug developers to invest in R&D for diseases they might otherwise ignore. After over a decade of experience, the evidence on how PRVs influence the drug development pipeline shows both promise and limitations. Empirical studies and reviews have found **little or no measurable effect** of the PRV programs on the overall rate of new drug development for targeted diseases. For example, a 2020 GAO report noted that few rigorous studies exist, and those that do failed to show a clear increase in development activity attributable solely to PRVs.[^1] However, **qualitative evidence suggests PRVs are indeed a factor in companies' strategic decisions**. In interviews with drug sponsors who had pursued qualifying drugs, most indicated the possibility of earning a PRV was considered in their development plans.[^2]

# 2. Sarepta Therapeutics: Case Study
*Sarepta Therapeutics* provides a telling example of how PRVs can shape a company's pipeline and financial trajectory. Sarepta is a biotech firm specializing in genetic medicines for rare neuromuscular diseases, notably **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.[^7] DMD is a fatal genetic disorder affecting young boys – exactly the type of rare pediatric condition targeted by the PRV program. Over the past decade, Sarepta has developed multiple DMD therapies, and in doing so it has amassed **four** rare pediatric PRVs – the most for any single company.[^8] These vouchers were awarded upon FDA approvals of: *Exondys 51* (2016), *Vyondys 53* (2019), *Amondys 45* (2021), and *Elevidys* (delandistrogene moxeparvovec, 2023).

## 2.1 Monetizing Vouchers for R&D Capital
Sarepta has opted to sell its PRVs for large sums, then reinvest the proceeds to fund its pipeline. For example, in July 2023 Sarepta sold the voucher earned from Elevidys' approval for $102 million in cash.[^9] Management explicitly stated that *"Sarepta will invest proceeds from the sale of the PRV into our R&D efforts to support the development of more transformative therapies"*. In other words, the voucher acted as a **de facto financing mechanism**, providing non-dilutive cash that can be poured into the next wave of gene therapy and RNA-based drug programs (Sarepta has over 40 programs in development [^9]).

## 2.2 Pipeline Expansion and Acceleration
The availability of PRVs has reinforced Sarepta's focus on rare pediatric indications. The company's leadership in DMD therapies was driven by scientific opportunity, but the PRV program provided an extra incentive to tackle multiple subtypes of the disease in succession. Each time Sarepta developed a therapy targeting a new DMD mutation (e.g., exon-skipping drugs for different exons), the possibility of another voucher (and its sale) added to the project's expected value.

# 3. Economic and Pricing Trends of PRV-Awarded Drugs
## 3.1 High Pricing of PRV-Earning Drugs
Drugs that earn priority review vouchers are often **orphan products or novel therapies** in areas with little to no competition – factors that typically lead to high launch prices. Indeed, a consistent trend is that PRV-awarded drugs carry premium pricing, frequently drawing scrutiny for affordability. For example, **Elevidys**, the DMD gene therapy approved in 2023 that earned Sarepta a PRV, was priced at **$3.2 million** for a one-time dose.[^15] This makes Elevidys one of the most expensive drugs in the world, second only to a hemophilia gene therapy priced at $3.5 million.[^16]
