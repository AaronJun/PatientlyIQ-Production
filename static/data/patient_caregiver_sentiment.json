        "reasoning": "Initial screening visit generates mixed emotions. High anxiety due to uncertainty about eligibility and extensive testing battery (26 assessments). However, hope is elevated as this represents potential access to new treatment. Physical burden is moderate with travel required and invasive procedures like blood draws and ECG."

High logistical burden with travel coordination and time investment. Hope is tempered by uncertainty, but the possibility of new treatment options maintains optimism."

Burden perception is lower with fewer assessments (14 vs 26 in screening). Receiving study drug represents tangible progress toward potential improvement."

Remote/virtual visit reduces physical and logistical burden while maintaining comprehensive assessment (21 assessments). Lower anxiety with familiar routine. Hope may increase as 2-month treatment milestone approached with reduced visit burden."

Hope increases with treatment continuation and reduced visit complexity. Most positive caregiver experience to date."
