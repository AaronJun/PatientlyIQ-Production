While the availability of enzyme therapies offers a critical lifeline, the day-to-day realities\u2014logistical, emotional, and physical\u2014often undermine that sense of progress. What emerges across patient narratives is not just a medical journey, but a sustained negotiation with systems, side effects, and uncertainty. Sentiment runs deeper than satisfaction or dissatisfaction; it reflects the strain of maintaining stability in a landscape where access, response, and relief are never guaranteed.",
