# Form Catalyst to Enduring Impact: The Evolution and Future of Priority Review Vouchers for Rare Pediatric Diseases

# Abstract
This paper examines the impact of the FDA's Priority Review Voucher (PRV) program on drug development for rare pediatric diseases and neglected tropical diseases. Through analysis of regulatory outcomes, economic trends, and case studies, we evaluate the program's effectiveness in stimulating innovation, its effects on drug pricing and patient access, and its relationship to other pharmaceutical incentives. While PRVs have successfully contributed to bringing dozens of novel therapies to market for previously untreatable conditions, challenges persist regarding the sustainability of high drug prices and ensuring equitable access. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for optimizing this market-based incentive mechanism to better balance innovation with affordability and public health impact.
# 1. Introduction: Influence on R&D Investment Decisions
The central rationale of Priority Review Vouchers (PRVs) is to motivate drug developers to invest in R&D for diseases they might otherwise ignore. After over a decade of experience, the evidence on how PRVs influence the drug development pipeline shows both promise and limitations. Empirical studies and reviews have found **little or no measurable effect** of the PRV programs on the overall rate of new drug development for targeted diseases. For example, a 2020 GAO report noted that few rigorous studies exist, and those that do failed to show a clear increase in development activity attributable solely to PRVs. [^1] Much of the rare disease innovation of the past decade can also be credited to the Orphan Drug Act incentives and scientific advances like gene therapy, making it difficult to isolate the PRV program's impact. However, **qualitative evidence suggests PRVs are indeed a factor in companies' strategic decisions**. In interviews with seven drug sponsors who had pursued qualifying drugs, all seven indicated the possibility of earning a PRV was considered in their development plans; six described it as *one of several factors* tipping the cost-benefit calculus, and one sponsor even called a PRV "pivotal" to its decision to develop a particular drug. This sentiment was echoed by industry executives, especially for small biotech firms: the prospect of selling a voucher for tens of millions can meaningfully improve the expected return on investment for a low-revenue disease area. [^2]
Moreover, the timing of reward is important – a PRV is granted upon approval, providing a relatively near-term payoff (or asset) as opposed to extended sales over many years. This "bonus" at product approval can be enticing to venture capital and investors, as it de-risks some of the financial uncertainty of developing drugs for very small populations. Concrete outcomes of the PRV programs can be seen in the **drug pipeline for rare pediatric diseases**. As of 2024, the FDA had awarded 53 rare pediatric PRVs covering 39 distinct diseases, and notably only *3 of those diseases had any prior treatment options*.[^3] That means roughly 36 new therapies for previously untreatable pediatric conditions reached approval, triggering vouchers. While not all of that innovation can be attributed to PRVs (many also benefited from orphan status, NIH grants, or disease foundation support), the voucher program appears to have provided an *extra push* in bringing forward treatments for ultra-rare and severe pediatric illnesses. Industry observers have described an "exponential uptick" in rare disease drug approvals in the 2019–2023 period as the first wave of PRV-incentivized projects matured. [^4] In the tropical disease arena, the results have been more modest but still positive: at least 15 new treatments for neglected tropical diseases (like malaria, Ebola, etc.) were approved and received vouchers in the first decade of the program.[^5] These include products that might not have been developed without the added incentive (for example, a treatment for Chagas disease by a small company was expedited by the lure of a voucher). In interviews, even skeptical experts concede that PRVs have *"been a factor"* – one health economist noted that while PRVs alone are not a panacea, they *"grease the wheels"* by layering an additional reward on top of existing incentives.[^6] Importantly, PRVs reward only **first-in-kind** therapies for a qualifying disease (especially in the pediatric program), which encourages companies to be the first to solve a medical challenge. This can front-load innovation (as seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, discussed below), though it does not directly incentivize follow-on improvements once a voucher has been claimed for a given disease.
# 2. Case Study – Sarepta Therapeutics
*Sarepta Therapeutics* provides a telling example of how PRVs can shape a company's pipeline and financial trajectory. Sarepta is a biotech firm specializing in genetic medicines for rare neuromuscular diseases, notably **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.[^7] DMD is a fatal genetic disorder affecting young boys – exactly the type of rare pediatric condition targeted by the PRV program. Over the past decade, Sarepta has developed multiple DMD therapies, and in doing so it has amassed **four** rare pediatric PRVs – the most for any single company.[^8] These vouchers were awarded upon FDA approvals of: *Exondys 51* (2016), *Vyondys 53* (2019), *Amondys 45* (2021), and *Elevidys* (delandistrogene moxeparvovec, 2023). Each of these drugs addressed a different subset of DMD patients (distinguished by genetic mutation type or therapy modality), and each qualified as a novel treatment for a rare pediatric disease. Sarepta strategically leveraged the PRV incentive in at least two ways:
### 2.1 Monetizing Vouchers for R&D Capital
Sarepta has opted to sell its PRVs for large sums, then reinvest the proceeds to fund its pipeline. For example, in July 2023 Sarepta sold the voucher earned from Elevidys' approval for $102 million in cash.[^9] Management explicitly stated that *"Sarepta will invest proceeds from the sale of the PRV into our R&D efforts to support the development of more transformative therapies"*.
In other words, the voucher acted as a **de facto financing mechanism**, providing non-dilutive cash that can be poured into the next wave of gene therapy and RNA-based drug programs (Sarepta has over 40 programs in development [^9]).
Similarly, Sarepta sold a prior voucher (from Vyondys 53) reportedly for around $108 million in 2020,[^10] and another (from Amondys 45) for an undisclosed sum around that time. Cumulatively, Sarepta may have generated on the order of $300–400 million from voucher sales over a few years, substantially bolstering its war chest. This capital has likely enabled the company to pursue expensive clinical trials (e.g., systemic gene therapies, gene editing projects) that otherwise would have required additional stock offerings or partnerships. In essence, PRVs have become part of Sarepta's **business model**, turning successful rare disease approvals into immediate funding for future research.
### 2.2 Pipeline Expansion and Acceleration
The availability of PRVs has reinforced Sarepta's focus on rare pediatric indications. The company's leadership in DMD therapies was driven by scientific opportunity, but the PRV program provided an extra incentive to tackle multiple subtypes of the disease in succession. Each time Sarepta developed a therapy targeting a new DMD mutation (e.g., exon-skipping drugs for different exons), the possibility of another voucher (and its sale) added to the project's expected value. This might have encouraged Sarepta to invest in therapies like Amondys 45 or Vyondys 53, which have relatively small patient sub-populations, knowing that a PRV could be earned. Moreover, Sarepta reportedly acquired a PRV on the open market in one case to accelerate approval of another gene therapy (for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy) – though that product has not yet reached filing. The net effect is that Sarepta's development pipeline has been very *PRV-focused*, concentrating on rare pediatric neuromuscular diseases where each success yields both a new drug *and* a voucher. From an investor perspective, this strategy has had mixed reception. On one hand, the repeated monetization of PRVs has provided substantial cash inflows, which is a positive for a pre-profit biotech. On the other hand, Sarepta's **stock performance** has been swayed more by the scientific and regulatory outcomes of its drugs than by one-time voucher sales. For instance, in 2023, Sarepta's share price was down about *13.7% year-to-date* by early July (versus a 10.2% decline in the biotech industry index)[^11] despite the FDA's accelerated approval of Elevidys and the impending $102M voucher sale. This dip was largely due to investor concerns over Elevidys' clinical data and narrow advisory committee vote.[^12] The stock did tick up on news of the PRV sale (since it strengthens the balance sheet), but the market typically prices in expected voucher revenue once a company's application is approved. In summary, Sarepta's case demonstrates that **PRVs can significantly affect a company's R&D funding and portfolio choices**, enabling it to undertake more projects in rare diseases. However, the ultimate success and value creation still depend on the drugs' efficacy, approvals, and uptake – the PRV is a helpful boost, not a guarantee of profitability. Sarepta's aggressive pursuit of DMD therapies, aided by PRVs, has benefitted patients by bringing multiple DMD drugs to market (7 different DMD treatments have been approved industry-wide, spanning Sarepta and others[^13]). It also illustrates a virtuous cycle intended by policymakers: reward reinvestment so that one breakthrough begets another. At the same time, critics note that Sarepta's therapies (like others earning PRVs) are extremely expensive, raising issues addressed in the next section.
# 3. Economic and Pricing Trends of PRV-Awarded Drugs
### 3.1 High Pricing of PRV-Earning Drugs
Drugs that earn priority review vouchers are often **orphan products or novel therapies** in areas with little to no competition – factors that typically lead to high launch prices. Indeed, a consistent trend is that PRV-awarded drugs carry premium pricing, frequently drawing scrutiny for affordability. Many are gene therapies, biologics, or specialized small-molecules with development costs that companies seek to recoup from a tiny patient population. As a result, *"remedies for rare diseases are typically exorbitantly priced to recoup development costs"*.[^14] For example, **Elevidys**, the DMD gene therapy approved in 2023 that earned Sarepta a PRV, was priced at **$3.2 million** for a one-time dose.[^15] This makes Elevidys one of the most expensive drugs in the world, second only to a hemophilia gene therapy priced at $3.5 million.[^16] Similarly, Bluebird Bio's gene therapies – **Zynteglo** for beta-thalassemia and **Skysona** for cerebral ALD, each of which earned a PRV in 2022 – launched at around $2.8 million and $3.0 million respectively. Even non-gene-therapy voucher drugs often come at high cost: **Spinraza**, the first SMA treatment (PRV in 2016), costs about $750,000 in the first year and ~$375,000 annually thereafter; **Voxzogo**, a daily injection for achondroplasia (PRV in 2021), costs roughly $320,000 per year. In tropical diseases, some PRV drugs are more affordable (e.g., a $15 dengue vaccine, or a $100 course antiparasitic) thanks to external funding and low-income pricing, but those are exceptions. Overall, the **PRV incentive does not require any pricing concessions**, so sponsors generally price these breakthrough therapies at levels the market will bear. The **affordability concerns** are significant: while a PRV might encourage development of a cure for a rare deadly disease, that cure may come with a price in the millions, putting severe pressure on healthcare payers and potentially limiting patient access if not managed properly.
### 3.2 Pricing Rationale and Market Dynamics
Companies justify the high prices of PRV-related drugs by pointing to the substantial R&D investments and the transformative value of these therapies. For one-time gene therapies like Elevidys, manufacturers argue that despite the upfront cost, they provide lifelong benefit and may actually be cost-effective compared to years of chronic care.[^17] Sarepta's CEO characterized Elevidys' $3.2M price as *"conservative"* relative to its hoped-for benefit.[^17] Nonetheless, the pricing patterns raise questions about **cost sustainability**. If every success in rare disease yields a million-dollar therapy, payers (insurance companies and government programs) could face cumulative financial strain as dozens of such drugs enter the market. Analysts have noted that the PRV program, by design, focuses on diseases with *small patient populations*, so the budget impact of any single drug is often limited in absolute terms (because few patients exist). However, as the number of rare disease therapies grows, the aggregate budget impact is climbing. For example, 7 different Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy drugs (across various mutation targets) now exist due to efforts by Sarepta and others.[^18]

Treating an individual DMD patient could involve sequential use of several $300k/year exon-skipping drugs and possibly a $3M gene therapy – a lifetime cost in the tens of millions for one patient. Payers worry that even as these drugs bring great health benefits, **the model of ultra-high prices may not be sustainable** if replicated across hundreds of rare conditions. Interestingly, the **secondary market for PRVs** indirectly influences drug pricing economics. When a company like Sarepta sells a voucher for $100 million, effectively that reward is being paid by another pharma company (the buyer) who intends to use it. The buyer, in turn, likely has a high-revenue drug in the pipeline (for a common condition) where shaving a few months off time-to-market is worth $100M+ in extra sales. Those buyers (often large pharma) will factor the voucher cost into their own product's financial model. If the drug they accelerate is a competitive mainstream drug (e.g., a new cholesterol drug or diabetes drug), they may not raise its price due to market forces, but they spent capital that could have gone to other R&D. In a sense, the PRV system shifts costs around within the industry. Critics argue this is *inefficient*: rather than directly funding needed R&D (through grants or prizes), the system creates a scenario where one company's pricey rare drug is subsidized by another company's future profits on a big drug. There is also an ethical dimension: some have likened the voucher to *"paying to skip the line"*, which commoditizes FDA review slots.

If a PRV is used to expedite a drug with marginal clinical novelty (say, a me-too drug for diabetes), then in effect a less critical product jumps ahead of potentially more important standard reviews. Indeed, GAO found that redeemed vouchers have been used for drugs treating **common conditions like HIV, type-2 diabetes, and arthritis** – applications that otherwise would not qualify for priority review.[^19] This means FDA had to prioritize these commercial drugs over other pending applications, simply because the sponsor paid for a voucher. While the public health impact may be minor (since FDA still meets PDUFA goals for others), it raises fairness concerns. The companies using vouchers on blockbuster drugs gain financially (faster to market, beating competitors), but one could argue this **privatizes a public good (regulatory time)** and could incentivize high prices on those blockbuster drugs to maximize the time advantage payoff. For instance, Regeneron paid $67.5M for the first voucher and used it on Praluent (a cholesterol drug) to beat Amgen's competitor to market by a few months.[^20] Praluent and its rival ended up expensive (~$14,000/year) by cholesterol drug standards, though competition and insurer pushback eventually drove discounts. In summary, **the PRV program has succeeded in bringing forth new therapies, but those therapies often come with very high prices** – a reflection of orphan drug economics rather than the PRV itself, but an important outcome nonetheless. The extra revenue that a PRV can generate (either by sale of the voucher or earlier sales of a drug using a voucher) strengthens companies' financial positions. However, patients and payers ultimately face the burden of high costs. This dynamic has caught lawmakers' attention, linking the discussion of PRV reauthorization with concerns about drug pricing (as noted in Senate debates where some questioned renewing PRVs without addressing price gouging).[^21] The next section will examine how these pricing issues translate into patient access and what mechanisms are in place to mitigate the impact on patients.
# 4. Patient Access, Insurance, and Market Impacts
### 4.1 Insurance Coverage of PRV-Driven Drugs
Given the often extraordinary prices of drugs that earn PRVs, a key question is whether patients can actually get these medications paid for by insurance. In general, new FDA-approved therapies – especially for serious or life-threatening conditions – **are eventually covered by major insurers**, but coverage policies can be stringent and take time to develop. For example, after Elevidys was approved in June 2023 at $3.2 million, insurance giant UnitedHealthcare announced coverage within weeks, but other insurers took a few months to outline their criteria.[^22] Payers typically conduct reviews (sometimes leveraging external cost-effectiveness analyses) to decide under what conditions a rare disease drug will be reimbursed. Commonly, insurers will require **prior authorization**, ensuring that the patient truly meets the label criteria (e.g., for Elevidys, the child must have DMD with a confirmed mutation and be in the specified age range). They may also require documentation that cheaper alternatives are not available or suitable (often moot for rare diseases with no alternatives). In many cases, insurers will cover the drug but try to negotiate rebates or outcomes-based agreements with the manufacturer to manage the financial risk. For instance, payers have engaged in outcomes-based contracts for gene therapies (money-back guarantees or installment payments if the drug doesn't work as expected). This was seen with drugs like Novartis's Zolgensma (a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, priced at $2.1M) – though Zolgensma didn't itself earn a PRV, it's analogous as a high-cost rare pediatric drug. The willingness of insurers to cover PRV-associated drugs often hinges on the **clinical benefit**: if the drug is seen as a breakthrough (transforming a fatal disease into a manageable one), payers are more likely to cover despite the cost, whereas if benefit is marginal or evidence uncertain (as was debated for some DMD exon-skippers), insurers may initially restrict coverage. Overall, however, **denial of coverage for cost alone is relatively rare** for life-threatening rare diseases – the public relations and ethical pressure typically force coverage in some form. One noteworthy market impact is that PRVs can accelerate time-to-coverage for large-market drugs. When a big drug uses a voucher to launch early, it reaches payers' desks sooner. If it's a drug for a common condition, insurers might have preferred another competitor or generics to come first. By arriving 4 months early, the voucher-backed drug might secure favorable formulary positioning or lock in patients. This competitive edge can shape market dynamics (as with the PCSK9 inhibitors for cholesterol – Regeneron's PRV-assisted Praluent briefly had an edge over Amgen's Repatha[^23], though both later had to drastically cut price due to payer pushback). Thus, PRVs can indirectly influence which therapies dominate a market, at least in the short term, which in turn affects patient access (since if one drug gets to market first and is covered, patients start on it and may stick with it).
### 4.2 Patient Assistance Programs
To address the affordability gap, virtually all manufacturers of PRV-awarded drugs have established **patient support and assistance programs**. For patients with private insurance, companies typically offer copay assistance: the Elevidys manufacturer's *SareptAssist* program, for example, will cover a patient's copays or coinsurance obligations up to a certain amount, effectively reducing out-of-pocket cost to as low as $0 for eligible privately insured patients.[^24] This is crucial because even with insurance, a 10% coinsurance on a $3.2M therapy would be $320k – an impossible sum for most families. Programs like SareptAssist ensure that families are not bankrupted by cost-sharing. However, these programs **cannot** pay costs for government-insured patients (Medicare, Medicaid) due to federal anti-kickback laws.[^24] For such patients, manufacturers donate to independent charitable foundations which can legally provide financial aid to patients. Additionally, companies often have *free drug programs* or compassionate use provisions for patients who are uninsured or underinsured. In the rare disease space, it's not uncommon for a company to provide the drug at no cost if insurance coverage is denied and no alternatives exist, especially during the period right after approval when payers are still formulating policies. The patient support programs go beyond financial help – they often assist with logistics, such as travel to specialized treatment centers, and handle insurance paperwork. The **case manager** approach is standard: Sarepta assigns families a dedicated case manager to *"investigate your insurance benefits [and] financial assistance needs"* and coordinate care.[^24] For complex treatments like gene therapies (which might require hospital stays or special administration), these programs are vital in guiding patients through the healthcare system. Despite these efforts, challenges remain. Early on, access can be limited if payers are slow to approve coverage or if prior authorization processes are cumbersome. Families may face weeks or months of uncertainty trying to secure approval for a $3M therapy. Some patients may fall through the cracks – for instance, those on Medicaid in states that are slow to adopt coverage for an expensive new therapy. Medicaid must cover FDA-approved drugs generally, but they can negotiate supplemental rebates; if a deal isn't reached, access might be delayed. **Real-world access** therefore can lag behind approval by several months and can depend on the patient's insurer and location. Another aspect is the role of **public programs**: Medicare, for example, will cover these drugs under Part B or D depending on how administered, but Medicare patients (rare for pediatric diseases, but some PRV drugs are for adults like certain tropical diseases or cancers) might face coinsurance of 20%. For a $100k drug, 20% is $20k – here too, charity assistance is key. State Medicaid budgets can be hit hard by a new rare disease drug (some states saw spikes in spending for Spinraza, for example), but Medicaid cannot easily exclude such drugs. They often rely on federal relief or supplemental rebates from manufacturers spread over years.
### 4.3 Market Impact and Patient Outcomes
From a patient perspective, the **ultimate benefit of the PRV program** is the availability of new therapies that improve or save lives. Access, while not universal, has been achieved for many – e.g., dozens of children have received gene therapies like Zolgensma, Skysona, and Elevidys through insurance coverage and assistance mechanisms. Over time, as more competing treatments for a condition emerge, there could be downward pressure on price or at least more options for payers to negotiate. For instance, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Sarepta's dominance might be challenged by new gene therapies from Pfizer or others; competition could moderate prices or expand access via different channels (clinical trials, etc.). However, one concern is **long-term affordability**: as PRV-driven innovation succeeds, patients with rare diseases may live longer and potentially transition to expensive chronic therapies afterward, meaning cumulative costs continue. Additionally, **health equity** issues arise – patients in wealthy countries benefit, while those in low-income countries may not access these high-cost drugs at all. PRVs themselves have no provision to ensure global access; a company can win a voucher for a tropical disease drug, for example, but still price the drug out of reach in the countries where that disease is endemic (unless NGOs or generic manufacturers step in). This has been a criticism: the PRV program *"largely failed to deliver medical innovation to those who need it most globally, except a few examples"*, according to one analysis.[^25] In domestic markets, though, **patient advocacy groups** and public pressure play a role in access. For many rare pediatric diseases, passionate advocacy groups push insurers and policymakers to cover new treatments despite costs. They were instrumental in the creation of the PRV program and remain active in urging Congress to renew it and to ensure patients can actually benefit from the fruits of the incentive. The presence of patient assistance programs is partially a response to this pressure – companies know they must demonstrate goodwill and not let cost be an absolute barrier, especially in pediatric cases. In conclusion, **patient access to PRV-associated drugs is being enabled but with significant effort**. Insurance coverage is the linchpin, supported by manufacturer assistance for cost-sharing. The market impact of PRVs has been positive for patients in the sense that new therapies exist where none did before. Yet it also means payers and society are grappling with how to pay for these advancements. Real-world access can lag and varies by insurance type, but over a few years post-launch, most eligible patients in the U.S. do get access through some mechanism. The larger question is whether this model (ultra-expensive drugs + vouchers + assistance programs) is sustainable or if adjustments are needed to align incentives with broad affordability.
# 5. Comparative Analysis: PRVs vs. Other Incentives
The PRV programs do not operate in isolation; they complement a landscape of other **"push" and "pull" incentives** aimed at encouraging pharmaceutical innovation in low-profitability areas.[^26] It is important to assess whether PRVs offer a unique stimulus or merely duplicate existing incentives such as R&D tax credits, grants, and market exclusivity rewards:
### 5.6 Do PRVs Complement or Duplicate?
In conclusion, PRVs primarily *complement* other incentive programs by providing an additional, flexible reward that can catalyze investment and fund further research. They were designed to *not* interfere with existing incentives – for example, they don't change the orphan exclusivity or patent system, they operate alongside. At the margins, there is some duplication in the sense that many PRV-winning products likely would have been pursued under orphan incentives alone. But evidence suggests PRVs have brought incremental effort into neglected areas (especially tropical diseases and certain pediatric conditions that might not have been touched otherwise). As one analysis put it, **no single incentive is sufficient by itself**; the PRV is one tool in the toolbox.[^27] If we consider alternatives, some have suggested that *perhaps PRVs are not the most efficient incentive compared to, say, direct funding*, since they rely on a market buyer. The next section discusses potential policy changes reflecting these debates.
# 6. Policy Implications and Future Considerations
As the PRV programs mature, policymakers and stakeholders are evaluating their effectiveness, fairness, and the need for reform. Several key **policy implications** have emerged:
### 6.1 Efficacy and Outcome Evaluation
After over a decade, it's a mixed report card. The rare pediatric voucher program can claim dozens of new therapies for previously untreatable diseases – a tangible success in line with its intent.[^28] The tropical disease program has seen some successes but fewer than hoped, partly because the diseases are so challenging and unprofitable that even a $100M voucher may not entice large firms. Critics point out that aside from a few high-profile examples, the PRV programs have *"largely failed to deliver"* the level of innovation expected in global health, especially when viewed against the enormous profits some voucher recipients or buyers have made.[^29] This critique, from global health experts, labels the PRV a *"misconceived quid pro quo"* – arguing that the public (via FDA's concession of priority review slots) gives up something valuable, but society doesn't always get commensurate value back.[^29] For instance, if a tropical disease drug gets a voucher but the drug is then sold at high price or not distributed widely in endemic countries, the public health benefit is limited. Policymakers must weigh these outcomes: is the PRV program the best way to stimulate innovation, or would other mechanisms (like grants, prizes, or changes to patent laws) be more effective or equitable? So far, Congress has tentatively continued the programs, indicating a belief that some incentive is better than none for these diseases.
### 6.2 Reauthorization and Program Extensions
The rare pediatric disease (RPD) PRV program was originally set to expire in 2020, but was renewed, and as of 2024 it faced another sunset (September 30, 2024). In late 2024, Congress passed a short-term extension to keep it alive until December 2024, and efforts are underway to further extend it.[^30],[^31] The fact that the program nearly lapsed caused significant anxiety among rare disease biotechs – some described being *"left in a lurch"* when the deadline passed without a full reauthorization.[^32] Companies with ongoing pediatric rare disease trials have been counting on vouchers as part of their business model; an abrupt end could undermine investment in those projects. Recognizing this, bipartisan bills like the **Creating Hope Reauthorization Act** were introduced in 2023 to extend the RPD program for several more years.[^33] One lesson is that tying such an important incentive to short-term sunsets creates uncertainty that can itself be counterproductive – investors become nervous if the program might vanish by the time a drug is approved. Many stakeholders advocate for making the RPD voucher program permanent (or at least long-term), similar to the tropical disease program which does not expire.[^34] On the flip side, some legislators (notably Senator Bernie Sanders) have taken the opportunity at sunset to demand reforms or even end the program on grounds that it enriches companies without sufficient public return.[^35] Sanders has used PRV reauthorization debates to highlight high drug prices and to push for broader drug pricing measures, essentially leveraging the must-pass nature of PRV renewal as a bargaining chip.[^35] So far, PRVs have enjoyed bipartisan support due to the compelling need for rare disease cures, but future reauthorizations may come with strings attached, which leads to the next point.
### 6.3 Potential Reforms for Fairness and Efficiency
Several reforms have been proposed to improve the PRV system: **6.3.1 Adjusting Eligible Diseases** Especially for the tropical disease program, there have been calls to **update the list of qualifying diseases** and possibly include more neglected conditions (such as certain emerging infections). Advocacy groups note that the WHO's Neglected Tropical Diseases list is longer than FDA's current list, and aligning them could yield more incentives for needed areas.[^36] Congress has shown interest, e.g., bipartisan bills to add **Valley Fever** to the tropical disease PRV list were introduced after frustration that FDA hadn't added it via guidance.[^36] Expanding the disease list could modestly increase the number of vouchers, but an FDA analysis suggests it likely wouldn't flood the program or drastically devalue vouchers because these are still very rare endeavors.[^36] Keeping the list up-to-date ensures the incentive targets remain relevant as new disease threats emerge. **6.3.2 Tiered or Conditional Vouchers** One idea floated in policy circles is to create **tiered voucher values or conditions**. For example, a voucher earned for a disease that primarily affects developing countries might come with conditions such as a requirement to have an access plan (discounted pricing or donation in endemic regions). This would tie the incentive to not just drug approval, but also to delivering public health impact. Another suggestion is to have vouchers of different priority levels (though currently a voucher always grants the same 6-month review target). So far, these ideas have not been implemented – all vouchers are uniform except differing by program type only in name. However, attaching **pricing or access conditions** to PRVs at issuance could address some fairness concerns. For instance, Congress could stipulate that if a sponsor wants to redeem a voucher, the drug that earned it must be marketed in a way that's accessible (or at least, not have an unreasonable price). This might conflict with other laws and philosophies (FDA typically doesn't regulate drug prices), so it's tricky. But the debate is ongoing: should a company that benefited from a PRV owe something back in terms of affordable patient access? Currently, the law does not impose such obligations. **6.3.3 Limiting PRV Usage to Certain Drugs** Some have suggested that PRVs perhaps **should not be usable on any drug of the sponsor's choosing**, because using them on a non-critical drug is seen as gaming the system. One could imagine a rule that the voucher can only be applied to a drug that also addresses an unmet medical need (albeit in a different area). However, that would defeat the attractiveness to buyers who often want to use them on big-market drugs. The broad usability is what drives high sale prices (a cancer or diabetes drug team will pay big for a voucher). So this reform is unlikely as it would reduce the reward value and thus the incentive effect on the front end. **6.3.4 Enhanced Notice or Spacing Mechanisms** To ease FDA's burden, policymakers might consider requiring earlier notice than 90 days for voucher redemption, or limiting how many vouchers can be re
deemed in a given quarter if FDA workload is too high. The FDA has not formally requested such changes, and it manages by hiring staff, but if priority review demand ever exceeded capacity, a policy to queue voucher use could be needed. So far this hasn't happened – priority reviews through vouchers are still a small fraction of FDA's total reviews. **6.3.5 Sunset vs. Permanent** As mentioned, moving to a more stable long-term authorization for PRVs could be beneficial. Congress might renew the RPD program for say 10 years instead of short increments, providing certainty. In exchange, they may ask for more rigorous **reporting on outcomes** – requiring FDA or GAO to periodically report how the program is working (number of drugs approved, their impact, etc.). Already GAO was tasked by the 21st Century Cures Act to review PRVs[^37]; future legislation might demand, for instance, that FDA analyze whether voucher redemptions slow other reviews or not, and certify that user fees are adequate.
### 6.4 Continuation vs. Replacement
A fundamental consideration is whether to continue the PRV programs or replace them with alternative incentive structures. Detractors of PRVs argue that while the concept is clever, it has some unintended consequences (like selling FDA review slots to the highest bidder) and that a direct approach could be cleaner. Alternatives suggested include: **direct monetary prizes** for approvals in certain disease areas (Congress could allocate, say, $100M per successful approval for Disease X, rather than a voucher), or **Advanced Market Commitments** (guaranteeing a market or purchase for a product, as was done for pneumococcal vaccines globally). Another is bolstering the **Orphan Drug Act** further – for instance, restoring the orphan tax credit to 50% or extending orphan exclusivity for especially underserved subgroups. The advantage of PRVs, however, is that they do not require government funding (the cost is absorbed by industry players) and they harness market forces (pharma pays what the voucher is worth to them). Any replacement that uses taxpayer money might face political hurdles. Therefore, many believe PRVs should be **reformed, not scrapped**. The sentiment from FDA's leadership has been positive: FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf in 2024 *"lauded the impacts of the Priority Review Voucher program"* as a valuable incentive for neglected diseases.[^38] This suggests that regulators see it as a net benefit. Additionally, rare disease patient organizations strongly support continuing PRVs, as they have seen the influx of development it brought. These groups would likely oppose any elimination without a equal or greater alternative in place.
### 6.5 International and Other Sectors
PRVs are a U.S.-specific incentive. Other regions like Europe do not have an equivalent, although Europe uses other tools (like extended market exclusivity for pediatric drugs). There's been discussion of whether the U.S. PRV concept could be expanded to other categories – for example, a voucher for developing a new non-opioid painkiller (to combat the opioid crisis) or for novel antibiotics (to fight antimicrobial resistance). In fact, draft legislation in the past considered vouchers for antibiotics, but it did not pass, partly because of concerns about prolonging patents on other drugs as a reward (the transferable exclusivity concept). If PRVs continue to be viewed favorably, we might see *creative expansions* – but each would need careful calibration to avoid flooding FDA with too many priority reviews or giving away too much value for insufficient public health gain. In conclusion, the future of PRVs will likely involve a **continuation with improvements**. Possible measures include reauthorizing the pediatric program long-term, refining disease eligibility lists, maintaining strong FDA funding to handle the workload, and perhaps integrating guardrails to ensure the vouchers translate into real public health benefit (not just company profits). Policymakers will closely watch metrics like how many new treatments are approved for previously untreatable diseases (already a significant number), the usage of vouchers (does FDA keep up without delaying other work?), and drug pricing trends post-approval. There is an inherent policy trade-off: PRVs *do* incentivize innovation – even GAO's interviewees acknowledged they factor into decisions[^39] – but they also introduce peculiar dynamics in regulatory prioritization and don't directly address the high prices of resulting drugs. Future reforms might aim to **strike a better balance**: preserving the incentive for development while possibly conditioning the reward to encourage reasonable pricing or broader access. As of now, with strong support from patient communities and many in industry, PRVs are poised to remain an important part of the drug incentive ecosystem. Continuing to study their impact (through academic research and GAO audits) will inform whether adjustments or a next-generation incentive (perhaps inspired by PRVs but more targeted) will eventually take their place.
# 7. Conclusion
Priority Review Vouchers have become a prominent, if unconventional, tool in pharmaceutical policy, leveraging the value of FDA review time to drive drug development for unmet needs. This comprehensive analysis finds that **PRVs have had a meaningful impact**: they have helped bring numerous drugs to market for rare pediatric and tropical diseases, providing companies an extra incentive that can influence R&D strategy and funding.[^40],[^41] The ability to redeem or sell a voucher for around $100 million has proven attractive to industry, as evidenced by the active secondary market and cases like Sarepta, which reinvested voucher proceeds to expand its pipeline.[^42] At the same time, the PRV system has introduced challenges. The FDA must manage accelerated reviews without compromising quality, a task it has handled thus far by using additional fees and shifting resources, though not without caution about workload strains.[^43] Economically, the program's success in spurring innovation comes with the side effect of **very high drug prices** for many PRV-awarded therapies, raising questions about long-term affordability and equity.[^44],[^45] Patients have benefited from new treatment options, but ensuring access requires robust insurance coverage and manufacturer assistance programs to mitigate cost barriers.[^46] In comparing PRVs to other incentives, we see a largely complementary role – PRVs stack on existing rewards (exclusivity, tax breaks, grants), enhancing the overall incentive package for developers.[^47],[^48] However, critics argue that this multi-layered incentivization may overshoot, rewarding companies multiple times for the same product without guarantees of broad access.[^49] As a result, **policy discussions are at a crossroads**. Congress and regulators are debating how to refine the PRV programs to maximize public health benefit. Options on the table include extending the pediatric voucher program with more rigorous oversight, updating qualifying criteria, and considering ways to tie the voucher reward to outcomes like affordability or global health impact. There is also contemplation of alternative models (like direct prizes or transferable exclusivity for other critical needs), but none have been implemented yet at scale. 

In conclusion, priority review vouchers represent a novel market-based incentive that has delivered **mixed but largely positive results** in stimulating drug development for underserved diseases. The FDA's workload has increased modestly due to PRVs, but mechanisms are in place to handle it, funded by industry user fees.[^50],[^51] The program's existence has clearly been a factor in corporate decisions to pursue challenging R&D projects, even if it is not solely responsible for each success.[^52] Moving forward, fine-tuning the balance between rewarding innovation and ensuring patient access will be crucial. Policymakers may need to ensure that incentives like PRVs do not just produce new drugs, but also affordable therapies that reach the patients who need them. The evidence to date suggests PRVs are a valuable incentive, but not a panacea – they work best in concert with other incentives and when backed by a healthcare system willing to support access to the resulting treatments. Further research could focus on the long-term outcomes of PRV-inspired drugs (are they improving survival and quality of life as hoped?), the cost-effectiveness of the PRV incentive model, and the exploration of similar incentive structures for other public health priorities (such as antimicrobial resistance). As the landscape evolves, the PRV programs will remain a fascinating case study in how economic tools can be used to direct biomedical innovation for social good, and how to optimize such tools for the future.
