# **California Walks Website & Branding Refresh  | Draft Scope of Work**

## Context 
California Walks arrives at a critical inflection point with the need to shift funding models—from one dependent on state and federal funding to one that incorporates private philanthropy and corporate partnerships.

As part of this effort, California Walks must revamp its public-facing branding and digital presence to reflect both its storied advocacy history and its broadened, dynamic future ambitions.

This scope of work is designed to balance impact with affordability. The phases are streamlined and modular; each success will build upon the one before it, enabling California Walks to move efficiently and effectively through this transition. We will also plan to work on both brand and web redesign in tandem, rather than distinct phases of work, such that we can expedite the process as much as possible. 

This path allows us to focus on the critical need to reposition California Walks quickly while laying the foundation for long-term growth and engagement.

The budgets have been discounted significantly from standard client pricing. These discounts are enabled by the streamlined approach, a reduced number of deliverables per phase, and the potential for strategic partnership opportunities, including:

* Seat on advisory board
* Right of first look for future communications/strategy work
* Co-branded case study following launch
* Inclusion in partner referral network

My hope is that we can work together for the long run. I expect and will work to help ensure that California Walks moves with confidence into this new phase of advocacy. This includes pro bono consultative work on donor messaging, outreach, and brand positioning strategy.
